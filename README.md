# Tweet Chop

A simple webapp to chop your paragraphs into tweetable bites and get ready for that awesome tweetstorm you're about to bring onto the world!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run the code on your machine, you will need first to install:
- Node

If you are on macOS X, you can install them using Homebrew
```
brew install node
```

> The latest the version, the better!

### Installing

Now that you have installed the needed software, let's look into getting this instance to run!

Run the following from the root of the project:

```
npm install
```

This will install all the dependencies for both the client and the server.

Finally, to kick things up, run the following:

```
npm start
```

If there are no errors and a webpage appears and it's functional, then you are pretty much set!

## Running the tests

The tests definitely need more attention, but you can run the existing tests with:

```
npm run test
```
